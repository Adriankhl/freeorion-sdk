# This Dockerfile contains build instructions to create a working and C++11
# capable build environment for FreeOrion on TravisCI.  The image is available
# via `freeorion/freeorion-travis-build`.

# Docker doesn't expose any feature to check if a Dockerfile would result in
# some tagged image on the docker registry for various reasons (hard to restore
# Dockerfile from fs-metadata, no return code for an recreated build from cache
# when using `docker build`, different file timestamps in fs-layers when running
# `apt-get`, apt-get not pulling consistent packages, â€¦).  To circument this a
# custom label called `version` is used. Whenever a new image should be deployed
# the version label value needs to be increased by one.

# coreutils is included to use timeout in travis-ci builds
